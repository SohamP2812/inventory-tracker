# Inventory Tracking Web Application - Shopify Developer Intern Challenge Fall 2022

My take on the Shopify Developer Intern Challenge for Fall 2022. Built a full stack web application built with ReactJS, ExpressJS, Node.JS, and PostgreSQL.
The primary purpose of this project was to build a robust and high-quality backend that is used for CRUD operations on a database to store inventory items
and inventory transactions.

Built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, with modelling and database being handled by Sequalize and Postgres, views being handled by React,
and control logic being handled by NodeJS with ExpressJS routes + functions.
